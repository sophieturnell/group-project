## Brief
Build a full stack app by creating your own front and back end using MERN (MongoDB, Express, React.js & Node.js). The app will most likely have multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models.

Timeframe: 1 week, group coding collaborating with [Vikram Bageja](https://github.com/vikram1510), [Reema Patel](https://github.com/missreems) and [Tom Good](https://github.com/TE-Good).


## Summary
'Tech Talk' is a full stack app that allows users to find and create tech related events by location and date. Users can create events, see who is attending, and comment on the events that they are attending. We built the whole app in JavaScript. Our back end used an Express API to serve the data from a Mongo database and is consumed by our front end built using React. 

This was a group project over a period of a week that required rigorous planning and constant collaboration. We used a combination of Visual Studio Live Share in VS Code to group code, and pair programming to set up the framework; we then split up to work on other individual elements. Git and Trello were instrumental for prioritisation and version control, and ensured our code wasn’t duplicated or conflicting. My responsibilities included: creating and then styling forms with Skeleton; the language buttons using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop; and the map element using Mapbox API and react-map-gl. 


## Deployment

Access techTalk [here](https://tech-talk-app.herokuapp.com/ "open me!") on Heroku.


### Installation Instructions
To run the app from the source code, use the clone button to download the source code from GitHub. From the root directory type "yarn","mongod", "yarn seed" and "yarn start" in the terminal. The project will run on localhost:4000, and will be viewable on any web browser.

## Challenges Overcome
- Adding functionality to the programming language search bar 
- Using Mapbox
- Avoiding duplicating code and causing conflicts within the group
- Agreeing on styling preferences for uniformity across the site
 

## Future Improvements
- Fully responsive design
- Develop a booking/payment system for events
- Direct chat facility between users
- Improved search filters 
- Increased functionality in the profile settings
- Add event images to the show page


## Takeaways
This was the first time we had linked the front and back end and it presented several challenges. Although communication broadly speaking was very good, going forward I will endeavour to spend more time pseudo-coding to ensure clarity within the team on all elements. 

**I learnt the importance of:**

- Good communication:
  - Commenting code to ensure everyone was able to see how elements they hadn't written worked
  - Regular Git commits with helpful comments

- Maintaining clarity on which features are core to the MVP, and which you can work on at a later date

- Writing automated tests for our RESTful resources on the back end to save time, particularly as the apps become more complicated
